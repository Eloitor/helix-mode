Emulating [Helix Editor](https://docs.helix-editor.Helix/) badly, by stripping down Evil mode to just the modes and adding some very simple interactive functions.

# Installation

Something like this? I use Straight.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package helix
  :straight (helix :type git :host github :repo "tprost/helix"))
(require 'helix)
#+end_src

You may need to install Evil mode, but don't require all of it.
